                                            "3. Increasing international collaboration involving many countries, especially recruiting scientists from China and other hotspot countries to these efforts.\n"

                                            "5. Changing human behaviors that pose a risk for coming into contact with bats, such as wet markets, bat cave tourism, capturing and eating bats, and perturbing the environment in ways that alter bat habitats and habits.\n"
                                            "6. Strengthening basic public health, including hygiene and sanitation to prevent viruses from amplifying replication. Building and maintaining a strong public health infrastructure for an efficient response to pathogen emergence is essential.\n"

                                            "The first political philosopher to call himself an \"anarchist\" was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the mid-19th century, marking the formal birth of anarchism. However, as noted in the context, the term \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism, particularly outside the United States."
                                            "Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms that are state-oriented or from above, and scholars of anarchism generally highlight its socialist credentials while criticizing attempts to create dichotomies between the two."
                                            "In summary, the term \"anarchism\" originates from Ancient Greek words and refers to a political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of authority and hierarchy, often in favor of voluntary free associations and stateless societies."), "assistant"),

The Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., operates a refinery in Tuscaloosa, while JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in the same city."
